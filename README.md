🧠✍️ Math Gesture Solver

Math Gesture Solver is a Python-based application that interprets handwritten mathematical expressions (drawn as gestures) and solves them in real-time using computer vision and OCR (Optical Character Recognition).

 🚀 Features

- ✍️ Detects hand-drawn math gestures from video or canvas
- 🔍 Converts gestures into mathematical expressions using OCR
- ✅ Solves and displays results instantly
- 📷 OpenCV-based real-time capture and processing
- 🧠 Integrates with `cvzone`, `mediapipe`, and `pytesseract`


 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **MediaPipe** for hand tracking
- **Pytesseract** for OCR
- **cvzone** for gesture UI
- **NumPy**
